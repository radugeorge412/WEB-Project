	<h2>Protein powder</h2>
	
	<img src="images/sup1.jpg" alt="sup1">
	<p>Protein is one of the building blocks of bone, muscle, and skin. The body needs it to produce hormones, enzymes, and other chemicals.
	
	Protein powders are powdered forms of protein that come from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, potatoes, or hemp), eggs, or milk (casein or whey protein).
	The powders may include other ingredients such as added sugars, artificial flavoring, thickeners, vitamins, and minerals. 
	The amount of protein per scoop can vary from 10 to 30 grams.<br><br> Supplements used for building muscle contain relatively more protein,
	and supplements used for weight loss contain relatively less.A 2018 analysis of 49 studies supports the use of protein supplementation for this purpose.
	The research suggests that protein supplements significantly improve muscle size and strength in healthy adults who perform resistance exercise training, 
	such as lifting weights.

	<div class="supp" id="casein">
	<h2>Casein</h2>
	<img src="images/sup2.jpg" alt="sup2">
	<p>Casein is a slow-digesting dairy protein that people often take as a supplement.

It releases amino acids slowly, so people often take it before bed to help with recovery and reduce muscle breakdown while they sleep.
Several studies have shown it helps boost muscle growth, along with a ton of other benefits.Milk contains two types of proteins — casein and whey.<br>
 Casein is 80% of the milk protein, while whey is 20%.
Casein protein is digested slowly, while whey protein digested quickly. This is an important difference between these two popular dairy proteins.
Like other animal proteins, casein is a complete protein source. That means it provides all the essential amino acids your body needs for growth and repair.<br>
A 33-gram (1.16-ounce) scoop of standard casein protein powder contains 24 grams of protein, 3 grams of carbs and 1 gram of fat.<br><br>
The myth that high protein intake causes ill health has been debunked many times.
Direct studies and reviews have highlighted that there are no negative effects in healthy individuals.
The only exception is those with current kidney or liver disease, who may need to limit their protein intake </p>

	<h2>Creatine</h2>
	<img src="images/sup3.jpg" alt="sup3">
	<p>Creatine is the number-one supplement for improving performance in the gym.
		Studies show that it can increase muscle mass, strength and exercise performance.Some people believe that creatine is unsafe and has many side effects, 
		but these are not supported by evidence (this supplement has been the most studied).<br>
		Creatine is a substance that is found naturally in muscle cells. It helps your muscles produce energy during heavy lifting or high-intensity exercise.
		Taking creatine as a supplement is very popular among athletes and bodybuilders in order to gain muscle, enhance strength and improve exercise performance.
		Chemically speaking, it shares many similarities with amino acids. Your body can produce it from the amino acids glycine and arginine.
		About 95% of your body’s creatine is stored in muscles in the form of phosphocreatine. The other 5% is found in your brain, kidneys and liver.<br>
		In high-intensity exercise, its primary role is to increase the phosphocreatine stores in your muscles.
	The additional stores can then be used to produce more ATP, which is the key energy source for heavy lifting and high-intensity exercise.

	<h2>Pre-workout</h2>
	<img src="images/sup4.jpg" alt="sup4">
	<p>
	They’re typically a powdered substance that you mix in water and drink before exercise.
	While countless formulas exist, there’s little consistency in terms of ingredients.
	Amino acids, B vitamins, caffeine, creatine, and artificial sweeteners are often included, but quantities can vary widely depending on the brand.<br>
	<br>Pre-workout formulas aren’t for everyone.

	If you frequently lack energy or have difficulty making it through your workout, you shouldn’t automatically resort to supplements.
	Adequate hydration, sleep, and diet are essential for any exercise routine to optimize your energy levels and help repair your muscles.
	Moreover, the variability in ingredients of pre-workout supplements makes it difficult to determine their effectiveness.
	They can also be expensive — and research hasn’t proven them to be more effective than whole foods that provide the same nutrients. For example,
	a banana and a mug of coffee is a suitable, cheap, and accessible alternative to a pre-workout supplement.
	That said, if you find that pre-workout formulas work for you, there’s no reason to stop. Just be mindful of their ingredients and your total intake.

	<h2>BCAA</h2>
	<img src="images/sup5.jpg" alt="sup5">
	<p>
	BCAAs consist of three essential amino acids: Leucin, Isoleucin, Valine. BCAAs are considered essential because, unlike non-essential amino acids, your body cannot make them.
	Therefore, it is essential to get them from your diet.Consuming BCAAs may help reduce physical and mental fatigue.
Studies in human participants report up to 15% less fatigue in those given BCAAs during exercise, compared to those who were given a placebo.<br>
In one study, this increased resistance to fatigue helped the BCAA group exercise for 17% longer before reaching exhaustion, compared to the placebo group.<br>
BCAAs may also help your muscles feel less sore after exercise.
One way they may do so is by lowering blood levels of the enzymes creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase, which are involved in muscle damage. 
This may improve recovery and provide some protection against muscle damage.<br>
BCAAs may help prevent weight gain and enhance weight loss. However, more research is needed to determine whether supplements 
provide any added benefits over a high-protein diet.<br>
Getting enough BCAAs is likely to boost muscle growth. You can get them from high-protein foods in your diet or through supplements.
