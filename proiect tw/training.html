	<h2>First of all...</h2>
	<p>
		Physical training may be started for a variety of reasons. It may be initiated by the individual or promoted by healthcare professionals 
		in the course of comprehensive medical care.
		Whatever the reason for discussing physical training, it is helpful to ask some basic questions before embarking on a more
		detailed assessment and setting realistic targets.<br><br>
		You should <b>NOT</b> start a fitness program without first consulting with your <b>doctor</b> in order to answer to the 
		following questions:  <br></p>
		<ol>
		<li>What is your current exercise routine?</li>
		<li>What is the current weight and body mass index (BMI)?</li>
		<li> Have you got any health problems?</li>
		<li>What forms of exercise and training are preferred, possible and appropriate? </li>
		</ol>

	<h2>Weight loss</h2>
	<p>For some people, loss of weight will be the prime objective of physical training. For others it will be a secondary but important gain.
	 Exercise is more than burning extra calories during training.
	Nevertheless, diet must not be forgotten and alcohol is also a potent source of 'empty' calories. <br>
	So, if we talk about fitness and weight loss, than we talk about cardio. Let's see wich type of cardio is the best!<br><br> </p>
	<h4 class="titluMic">HIIT (high-intensity interval training) vs LISS (low-intensity steady-state) cardio</h4>
	<p>Calories are measured by how much work you did. So, if you sprint-walk 3 miles (HIIT) in 20 minutes you will burn less calories than 
	walking 4 miles in 1 hour (LISS), because 4 miles > 3 miles. You need more energy from food to walk 4 miles than 3.<br>
	Some people say that LISS does not burn so much calories beacuse your body gets used to it. This affirmation is completely false. You walked 
	since you were a baby, but this doesnt mean your body does not consume energy just because you are "used" to it
	. HIIT cardio is gonna cause you to overtrain, it is for olympic level athletes. The only thing that is gonna make you
	lose weight is burning calories and eating in deficit.<br><br>

	<h2>Training for mass</h2>
	<p>
	The main idea to gain muscles is weight lifting and calories intake (will talk about this part in the Nutrition section).<br>
	The weight lifting part is based on "progressive overload" principle. This principle involves continually increasing the demands on the
	musculoskeletal system to continually make gains in muscle size, strength, and endurance. Simply put, in order to get bigger and stronger
	, you must continually make your muscles work harder than they're used to. Most often, that means increasing the resistance.The human body 
	will not change unless it's forced to. That's why you can never grow complacent with your training. Once you fall into a comfort zone and the
	workouts are no longer challenging, you'll plateau. <br>
	You can increase resistance by going harder than last time. The methods to do this can be:<br><br></p>
	<h4 class="titluMic">Go for more load</h4>
	<p>Probably the most obvious way to increase the demands you place on your muscles is to increase the load, or weight.
	If 75 pounds is too easy when curling, try putting 5 pounds on each side of the barâ€”that should be more challenging! Remember,
	there's an inverse relationship between load and reps, so when you increase the weight, your reps are going to fall to some degree. 
	That's OK, because soon enough, you'll get stronger with that resistance and be able to repeat the cycle over again.<br><br> </p>
	<h4 class="titluMic">Increase the reps </h4>
	<p>You don't necessarily have to add weight; alternatively, as you get stronger, you can simply do more repetitions, which is considered another means of increasing the overload. Never stop a movement when you reach an arbitrary rep count; keep going until you can't complete any more on your own with good form.

Exercise science indicates that to maximize your muscle-building efforts, the point at which you end your set should be in the 8- to 12-rep range. 
So you wouldn't want to indefinitely keep adding reps as you get stronger, because those incremental gains at some point would improve muscle endurance
 rather than muscle size. When you reach 12 reps or so, you should increase the resistance rather than simply trying to do more. Your reps will come down,
 but it'll keep you in that ideal range for hypertrophy.<br><br> </p>
 
	<h4 class="titluMic">Increase the volume </h4>
	<p>This variable is another way to increase the overload. Volume is simply sets multiplied by reps multiplied by resistance.
	By adding more sets (either by doing more exercises or adding another set for your existing exercises), you're making progressively greater
	demands on your muscle tissue. Remember, too, that since your reps are best constrained to the 8-12 range and the loads you use don't change
	dramatically to stay in that range, increasing your total sets is the best way to increase total training volume.
	That may mean doing 3 sets instead of 2 for all the exercises in your routine, or adding another movement
	(hopefully from a slightly different angle to emphasize a different area of the muscle).<br><br> </p>
