	<h2> About our bodies</h2>
	<br>
	<p>First, we have to understand one simple rule: <strong>WE ARE DIFFERENT!</strong> <br>
	In fitness, that means if two people of same age, same weight, same height, would train the same
		they would <strong>NOT</strong> get the same results. The reason is because we have different genetics, and genetic plays the most important part in fitness.
		One person with good genetic can get better results twice or three times faster than a person with not so good genetic.
	</p>
	<p>
	<br>
	There are 3 main types of "bodies" (somatic):<br>
		
		Ectomorphs are long and lean, with little body fat, and little muscle. 
		They have a hard time gaining weight. Fashion models and basketball players fit this category.
		While most of us love to hate these genetically-blessed individuals, some male ectomorphs may not be thrilled with their narrow-chested frames,
		and some female ectomorphs long for more womanly curves. <br><br>
		
		Endomorphs, on the other hand, have lots of body fat, lots of muscle, and gain weight easily.
		Football lineman tend to be endomorphs -- they're heavier and rounder individuals.
		And they don't have to necessarily be overweight. Both Oprah Winfrey and Marilyn Monroe are classic examples of endomorphs. <br><br>
		
		Mesomorphs are athletic, solid, and strong. They're not overweight and not underweight
		and they can eat what they want without worrying too much about it. They both gain and lose weight without too much effort.
		
		People may have more than one body type. For example, ecto-endomorphs are pear-shaped. They have thinner upper bodies and more fat storage
		on the lower half.
        Endo-ectomorphs, on the other hand, are apple-shaped, with more fat storage in the upper body with thinner hips, thighs, and legs.
