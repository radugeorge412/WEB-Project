	Starting a fitness program may be one of the best things you can do for your health.
After all, physical activity can reduce your risk of chronic disease, improve your balance and coordination,
help you lose weight, and even boost your self-esteem. And you can reap these benefits regardless of your age, sex or physical ability.<br><br>
The Department of Health and Human Services recommends that healthy adults include aerobic activity and strength training in their fitness plans, specifically:
at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week, or an equivalent combination of moderate and vigorous aerobic activity
Strength training exercises of all the major muscle groups at least twice a week.
<br>
Regular exercise can help you control your weight, reduce your risk of heart disease and certain cancers, and strengthen your bones and muscles.
But if you haven't exercised for some time and you have health concerns, you may want to talk to your doctor before starting a new fitness routine.<br><br>
When you're designing your personal fitness program, consider your fitness goals. Think about your fitness likes and dislikes, and note your personal 
barriers to fitness. Then consider practical strategies for keeping your fitness program on track.<br>
Starting a fitness program is an important decision, but it doesn't have to be an overwhelming one. By planning carefully and pacing yourself, you can
 make fitness a healthy habit that lasts a lifetime.

	<h2>Nutrition Intro</h2>

	<p class="paragraf">
	Nutrition is the study of how food and drink affects our bodies with a special regard to the essential nutrients necessary to support human health. 
It looks at the physiological and biochemical processes involved in nourishment and how substances in food provide energy or are converted into body tissues. 
These nutrients which are the source of energy for our bodies are classed as: carbohydrates, fats, fibre, minerals, proteins, vitamins, and water. <br><br>
Good nutrition means obtaining the right amount of nutrients from healthy foods in the right combinations.
An important part of the study of nutrition is looking at the diseases that can result from malnutrition and the role food plays in the development
of chronic disease.<br> <br>
Nutrition is also about why we choose to eat the food we do, even when we know they may not be good for us. What is going on at a cellular level and how does 
that affect what we crave and set up food cycles that are unhealthy or damaging.
